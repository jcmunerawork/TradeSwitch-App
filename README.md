# TradeManager

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.4.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 22.20.0 or higher
- **npm**: Version 11.6.0 or higher

### Installing Node.js

If you don't have the correct Node.js version, you can:

1. **Download directly**: Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest LTS version
2. **Using NVM (recommended)**: 
   ```bash
   # Install NVM first, then:
   nvm install 22.20.0
   nvm use 22.20.0
   ```
3. **Using Chocolatey (Windows)**:
   ```bash
   choco install nodejs --version=22.20.0
   ```

### Verifying Installation

```bash
node --version  # Should show v22.20.0 or higher
npm --version   # Should show 11.6.0 or higher
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
